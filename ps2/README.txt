To compile my code type "ruby ngrams.rb" and then the specified file paths for the training file and the test file after. For example, if my training file was in the subdirectory "files" I would type the following:
    ruby ngrams.rb "files/training-file.txt" "files/test-file.rb"
to run the application.

I am going to be testing my code on lab1-12.eng.utah.edu

So far so good! I have not seen any bugs or problems! Hopefully I get a good score! Let me know if you have any problems!
