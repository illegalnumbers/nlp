bugs-I was unable to fully complete the assignment, my initial design was determined to be unacceptable to complete the assignment as designed and I had to scrap my entire implementation once I realized this and wasn't able to finish. The program relearns the same spelling rules most times and there is a problem with tie-breaking for learning rules, this causes my problems to compound on themselves with each iteration. The program learns most initial rules fine, and I think due to the tie-breaking issue I get inconsistent results (ie. sometimes the final decision list can be different and thus different rules can be applied to the test set).
